Currently, I am an <a href="https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/science/staff/jennifer-sobeck">Associate Scientist</a> at <a href="https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/">Caltech/IPAC</a>.

I am currently assigned to the Science Support Center (SSC) for the <a href="https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/project/roman">Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</a>.

My scientific research has centered on variety of topics that include: the chemical and kinematic characterization of stellar populations in the Milky Way and 
Local Volume; the study of chemical evolution and nucleosynthetic mechanisms in stellar populations; and the detailed determination of fundamental atomic and 
molecular inputs for stellar analysis.  

Over the course of my career, I have acquired expertise in several programming languages (high proficiency: Python, Fortran, IDL; moderate proficiency: SQL, R) and a 
wealth of experience with various software.  

I am the primary developer of <a href="https://github.com/jsobeck/MOOG_SCAT">MOOG_SCAT</a>, a radiative transfer code that 
incorporates coherent, isotropic scattering.
