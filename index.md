Currently, I am the System Scientist for the 
<a href="http://mse.cfht.hawaii.edu">Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer</a>.

My scientific research has centered on variety of topics that include: the chemical and kinematic characterization of stellar populations in the Milky Way and 
Local Volume; the study of chemical evolution and nucleosynthetic mechanisms in stellar populations; and the detailed determination of fundamental atomic and 
molecular inputs for stellar analysis.  


Over the course of my career, I have acquired expertise in several programming languages (Python, Fortran, IDL, R) and a wealth of experience with
various software.  

I am the primary developer of MOOG_SCAT, a radiative transfer code that incorporates coherent, isotropic scattering.
