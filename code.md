## MOOG_SCAT
MOOG_SCAT is based on the LTE radiative transfer code MOOG developed by C. Sneden (1973). It contains modifications that allow for 
the treatment of isotropic, coherent scattering in stars. MOOG_SCAT employs a modified form of the source function and solves 
radiative transfer with a short characteristics approach and an acclerated lambda iteration scheme.
