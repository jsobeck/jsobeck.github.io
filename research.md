A major thrust of modern astrophysics is to identify and understand the sequence of events that gave rise to present-day galaxies.  

Systematic investigations of galaxy formation and evolution rely upon various observational approaches: photometric data acquisition from low to high spatial 
resolution of galaxies and associated stellar populations that span broad ranges in parameters (e.g., mass, luminosity, and redshift) and spectroscopic data 
acquisition from low to high spectral resolution of galaxies and associated stellar populations (low resolution studies will span large parameter ranges while 
high resolution studies will be limited to the Milky Way and Local Group).  

The information from the low resolution approaches (bulk properties) can be combined with that from the high resolution approaches (detailed properties on a 
star-by-star basis) to analyze the chemodynamical processes that govern galactic assembly and growth.
